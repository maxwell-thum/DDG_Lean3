\chapter*{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

This is an interactive blueprint to help with 
the formalisation of several definitions and results
from \emph{discrete differential geometry}, using 
Keenan Crane's textbook as a general template.

Nonetheless, we will be sparing with non-mathematical remarks, and will not usually trouble to explain the context of a particular lemma, or what it's `really saying', and so on -- we will present everything necessary to formalise the proof in Lean, no more and no less.

The actual Lean code can be found at (\url{https://github.com/maxwell-thum/DDG_Lean3}). % If you'd like to contribute in any way, or have any questions about this project, please email me at bloom@maths.ox.ac.uk. 

This blueprint is adapted from the blueprint of Thomas F. Bloom and Bhavik Mehta's Unit Fractions project (\url{https://github.com/b-mehta/unit-fractions}), which was itself based on the blueprint created by Patrick Massot for the Sphere Eversion project (\url{https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion}).

This blueprint uses Patrick Massot's leanblueprint plugin (\url{https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint}) for plasTeX (\url{http://plastex.github.io/plastex/}).
